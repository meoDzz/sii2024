                    <p>Advancements in mobile robot technologies have led to widespread civil applications in
                      civil. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) utilizing their vision capturing capacity can inspect
                      critical assets such as bridges, tunnels, pipelines, and more. Unmanned Ground Vehicles
                      (UGVs) equipped with various sensors can be deployed on difficult terrain and in confined
                      spaces, can complement the capabilities of UAVs. They together provide ideal tools for
                      comprehensive inspection/monitoring of infrastructure and critical sites.​</p>
      
                    <p>There exist, however, many challenging problems that require a system integration
                      approach to tackle. Research in topics such as formation control, cooperative planning,
                      IoT-enabled cooperation, heterogeneous vehicle coordination, moving object tracking,
                      fault diagnosis and fault tolerance, communication and networking, and energy efficiency
                      enhancement, among others, are still open for further exploration.​</p>
      
                    <p>This Special Session aims to bring together researchers from around the world to discuss
                      the vision, challenges, and key approaches in hardware and software for multiple mobile
                      robots, including UAVs and UGVs, with a system integration methodology in mind.​</p>

                    <p>Robot prototyping and manufacturing have been done with parts based on traditional
                      machining such as cutting, sheet bending, and die casting. The rapid progress of 3D
                      printing technology in recent years has fundamentally overturned these methodologies. It
                      can enable the development of lighter and higher-performance robots at a lower cost and
                      in a shorter development time. On the other hand, 3D printed materials are lightweight but
                      have low rigidity, and the parts are anisotropic.​</p>
      
                    <p>In this session, we aim to establish a robot design methodology based on 3D printing
                      technology and discuss the basic characteristics of 3D printing, the fastening of parts, and
                      the robot system using these parts.​</p>

                    <p>With the rapid progress in the fields of robotics and

                      the development and operation of robotic systems has been widely recognised. This
                      special session provides a forum for presenting new research results and discussing
                      cutting-edge research topics and issues of broad interest in related fields. Papers on
                      ergonomics, robotics, mechatronics, behavioural science, social science, design, health,
                      human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, haptics, etc. are welcome for submission

                      All robotics and mechatronics systems operate in interaction with the human who uses them
                      and the environment in which they are used. In other words, it is not sufficient to discuss the
                      system alone, but the interaction between the system, its user and environment should be
                      discussed. We are convinced that in recent years, robotic and mechatronics systems in
                      which human and systems co-operate have rapidly become widespread, and that
                      discussions about systems that inevitably encompass human factors are important.

                    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant upheaval in manufacturing systems across the globe and
                      has led to an economic recession in numerous countries. The disruption caused by the epidemic has
                      underscored the importance of prioritizing resilience in manufacturing systems as a means to revive
                      economic activities. However, it is crucial to recognize that in addition to focusing on resilience,
                      integrating human-centricity into the design and operation of these systems is equally vital for ensuring
                      sustainable development during the ongoing transition from Industry 4.0 to 5.0.​</p>

                    <p>Mechatronics has been extremely useful in industry and has developed human society.
                      Advances in mechatronics have led to the realization of various types of robots. In addition,
                      mechatronics technologies have started to be used to create robots that coexist with humans,
                      like living creatures. On the other hand, soft materials, which is flexible and stretchable, have
                      not been actively introduced into robots until now. In recent years, soft materials are known
                      to be able to exhibit autonomy and adaptability like living organisms. Thus, system
                      integration of soft materials and mechatronics is one of the most important themes in soft
                      robotics.​</p>
                    <p>
                      Some venture companies have started up regarding soft grippers, which has a ripple
                      effect on the industry. Soft grippers are one of the most attractive soft robotic technologies,
                      with investments of about $100 million. Soft grippers solve the critical problem of gripping
                      delicate, deformable materials and objects with complex and unpredictable shapes that
                      conventional rigid hands cannot grasp. In other instances, artificial muscles based on fluidic
                      actuators have led to the development of human-assist devices, facilitating the integration
                      of man and machine. Stretchable sensors can easily acquire biometric information from
                      human. Thus, soft materials advance the integration of human and machines.

                    <p>Robots today are gaining in popularity and complexity. At the same time, their tasks and
                      environments are also increasing in complexity. Recent advances in machine learning have
                      allowed to bridge that gap and enabled robotics to present itself as a practical solution to several
                      real-world problems. The proposed special session aims to promote research focused on, but not
                      limited to, robotics with applications to the environment, construction, forestry, agriculture, mining,
                      subsea, infrastructure, search, and rescue, among others - with emphasis on machine learning
                      applications. Experimental robotics and works possessing both theoretical and practical
                      significance will be promoted.​</p>

                    <p>
                      Robots are increasingly gaining in complexity, with an ever-increasing number of forms
                      and functions. In parallel, the tasks, problems and environments tackled by robots are
                      also increasing in complexity. Robotics with focus in field applications must therefore
                      bridge across several fields such as sensing, machine learning through system integration
                      in order to allow deployment of robots in the field.

                    <p>
                      Manpower shortage is becoming a big problem especially in Japan. The technologies are
                      expected to solve the problem. However, real problems are sometimes too complicated to
                      solve with present methods, or sometimes no novelty but requires muddy works to meet
                      each problems. Therefore, new theory, more efficient system integration method and

                      health care sector, by introducing robot technology to facilitate the health care
                      personnel, in order to focus their work on their expertise field.
                      However, there are several challenges in the health care, due to the fact that he
                      service-robots operate in the same environment as the care givers and sometimes,
                      patients with limited cognitive skills. Thus, new, solutions, creating on the intersection between traditional engineering and 
                      social science field, are required for the future service-robots.

                    <p>As developed nations grapple with burgeoning elderly populations, maintaining quality
                      care without overburdening healthcare structures has become pivotal. In the face of
                      declining healthcare workforces and rising costs, innovative solutions are essential to adjust
                      the demand. Robotics and AI technologies offer promising avenues for efficient, costeffective, and personalized aging care.
                       This session seeks to advance this crucial field by encouraging inter-disciplinary dialogues and research on AI and robotics support and care
                       systems for an aging society. From home and care facility automation to smart assistive
                       devices, service robotics and robot-telecare support, we invite novel insights into how
                       technology can foster elder independence, lessen caregiver load, and streamline healthcare
                       institutions. Further, we welcome exploration into AI-enhanced health monitoring,
                       rehabilitation, virtual reality/augmented reality applications, and machine learning-based
                       data analytics. As the integration of these diverse services forms an essential facet of longterm, sustainable solutions,
                        we are particularly interested in discussions on multi-sensory
                       input systems and comprehensive support feedback. With this session, we aim to bridge
                       research gaps and catalyse a transformation in healthcare, ultimately shaping a future
                       where robotics technology and care harmoniously intertwine

                      Recent years have seen the increasingly apparent effects of an aging population,
                      highlighted by declining birth rates and labour shortages in many countries. In the
                      forthcoming three decades, it is projected that the elderly will make up more than half of the
                      population in regions such as Japan, South Korea, and Europe. Robotics and AI
                      technologies are poised to play a crucial role in bolstering healthcare provision and
                      alleviating existing pressures. Researchers around the globe are diligently exploring cuttingedge solutions in service and 
                      care robotics. This includes rehabilitation, advanced assistive
                      devices, and ambient assisted living enabled by home automation and exercise support
                      systems. Large scale projects such as the JST Moonshot project in Japan is evident of such
                      effort to accelerate robotics and AI research in elderly care. As such, this session promises
                      to be of considerable interest to numerous research groups, offering a platform to explore
                      and discuss the current state-of-the-art and prospective solutions for these critical
                      technologies.

                    <p>A  robotic  teleoperation  system  is  necessary  to  explore  disaster  sites  and  unmanned 
                      construction.  To  effectively  achieve  teleoperation  tasks,  human  operators  of  robots  need 
                      information about the surrounding environment and the robot itself. In this session, studies 
                      on  robotic  teleoperation  are  introduced  from  the  aspect  of  remote  control  systems  and 
                      sensing technologies to supply the information on sites to operators.

                      Recently, demand for robotic teleoperation systems is rising rapidly due to a large number of calls for disaster responses 
                      such as decommissioning of nuclear power plants and unmanned construction for recovery after natural disasters. To achieve these missions, 
                      a wide variety of specialties are required. Potential authors of this special session are chosen from several kinds of fields on robotic teleoperation such as nuclear professional, human interface, 
                      and environmental sensing. Furthermore, the topics for disaster response are gathering social attention. We believe the topics of this session will interest not only researchers of robotics but also ones of other fields.

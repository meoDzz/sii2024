                  <p> This talk introduces our cutting-edge sensor technology based on Silicon (Si) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) Micro
                    Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and demonstration of their applications in the fields of robotics and smart
                    cities.
                    The presentation will begin with introducing advanced sensing effects in semiconductors, the development of
                    high-performance micro/nano sensors, and finally, demonstrations of some applications.
                    MEMS relate to the research and development of integrated micro/nano electro-mechanical sensors and actuators
                    based on
                    microelectronic technology to achieve high precision and throughput. MEMS sensors offer distinct advantages over
                    traditional sensors, including compact size, lightweight, low power consumption, high accuracy, and
                    cost-effectiveness
                    thanks to its mass production capabilities.
                    Recently, silicon MEMS sensors are gaining significant attention due to its compatibility with semiconductor and
                    IC chip
                    technology, which is emerging as a national priority in many countries, including Vietnam.
                    Our discovery of innovative sensing concepts and the development of high-performance sensors will advance the
                    robotics
                    industry and Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart cities applications.

                  <p> The rise of autonomous vehicles and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) is driving cutting-edge technologies in
                  multiple areas, for example, AI, control, simulation, testing, and safety… The ADAS system is complex with multi-modal
                  sensors and algorithms (perception, planning, and control). Another major challenge is the diversity of the traffic
                  environment, particularly in edge scenarios. The strict safety and comfort requirements are also pushing the design and
                  testing technologies. This talk discusses some R&D activities on how Siemens is leveraging Digital Twin tools to support
                  the ADAS engineering developments. The focuses are on three pillars: Sim2Real - from simulation to physical vehicle
                  testing (XiL development cycle), Real2Sim - from real data to simulation-based testing, and safety-comfort algorithms
                  (control, AI). Some autonomous driving use cases will be demonstrated." "Dr. Son Tong is an ADAS R&D Manager at Siemens
                  Digital Industries Software, working on automated driving, control systems, and AI engineering topics. Son Tong is
                  active in research and commercial autonomous system programs. He is technical coordinator for Siemens at multiple EU
                  programmes such as Enable-S3 (ADAS V&V), FOCETA (Trustworthy AI), and Marie Curie ELO-X (Embedded learning and
                  optimization). The technologies often involve state of art algorithms, simulation and physical testing methods. He was
                  awarded Siemens PL Invention of the Year Award, and selected in the AutoSens most influential research award finalist.

                    We maintains and operates a wide variety of large civil work infrastructure in the United States including over 700
                    locks and dams and tens of thousands of kilometers of levees. Much of this infrastructure has exceeded its design life
                    and requires continuous assessment, maintenance, and repair. Conventional repair and rehabilitation of waterways
                    infrastructure requires costly shutdowns, is labor intensive, and exposes personnel to hazardous conditions. The
                    Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) is responsible for research and development of new technologies and
                    capabilities that will allow for repairs and rehabilitations to be conducted rapidly, minimize project outages, reduce
                    labor burden, and increase safety for personnel. Autonomous robotic systems have the promise to automate inspection and
                    repair of critical infrastructure, but present challenges due to the unstructured complex operational conditions. This
                    presentation will discuss current challenges and existing robotic and autonomous technologies developed by ERDC.

                  <p> The rise of autonomous vehicles and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) is driving cutting-edge
                    technologies in
                    multiple areas, for example, AI, control, simulation, testing, and safety… The ADAS system is complex with
                    multi-modal
                    sensors and algorithms (perception, planning, and control). Another major challenge is the diversity of the
                    traffic
                    environment, particularly in edge scenarios. The strict safety and comfort requirements are also pushing the
                    design and
                    testing technologies. This talk discusses some R&D activities on how Siemens is leveraging Digital Twin tools to
                    support
                    the ADAS engineering developments. The focuses are on three pillars: Sim2Real - from simulation to physical
                    vehicle
                    testing (XiL development cycle), Real2Sim - from real data to simulation-based testing, and safety-comfort
                    algorithms
                    (control, AI). Some autonomous driving use cases will be demonstrated." "Dr. Son Tong is an ADAS R&D Manager at
                    Siemens
                    Digital Industries Software, working on automated driving, control systems, and AI engineering topics. Son Tong
                    is
                    active in research and commercial autonomous system programs. He is technical coordinator for Siemens at

                    optimization). The technologies often involve state of art algorithms, simulation and physical testing methods.
                    He was
                    awarded Siemens PL Invention of the Year Award, and selected in the AutoSens most influential research award
